LOTS of data can be exported from Google, if you've got your location data turned on.

So much that it's kinda overwhelming. So I'm taking a creative approach to this project to show where I've gone in 2022. To tell a story that gives a glimpse at the stories I lived/told in 2022.

ideas/notes:

* because google tracks everything (in lots of detail) when I walk around, we'll do some distance things to show moving around. then if big enough distance between, it'll put me in a diff city (i'll take city labels)
* could be interesting to show city in final?
* add some callouts/popups for some special stories/mems/highlights as the animation plays hopping around
* maybe do some random/small/static vizzes w/ other data google gives at the bottom? like the probability of way of transportation? (fun facts + highlight some other data that is avail)
* do any callouts on privacy/data lit for this? why it's cool but also need to be careful/aware of what's being used and consciously accept this??
* should I include just start + end points? or whole waypoint path?? or maybe de-aggregate the paths into just a long list of locations and go from there??? then can make sorta de-agg/more creative viz that doesn't rely on order of visits as precisely (and then I don't have to manually verify if I actually went to a place or just walked by...)

TODO: figure out how to convert this to DF and extract all places
ooh there's actually different lists! there are 'activity segments' and place visits. maybe I just take the place visits. make this easier! then it would rely on google's models to determine if I "visited" or just walked by
